ADVANCEMENT
1 the following layouts have been designed
1) search scenario
2) user scenario
3) setting scenario

2 some demos have been run successfully, meaning that we have fetched photos from the Flickr server
1) SwiftFlickrSearch
search photos from flickr server and display them
2) FlickrKit\DemoProject\FlickrKitSwiftDemo (FlickrKit is an API Kit, facilitating call Flickr APIs more easily)
login to Flickr server using Yahoo account, and then view the everyday recommended pictures

3 the swift language is choosen
If necessary, we can use Swift and Object C together

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUTURE PLAN
1 be familiar with the two demos(API kits):
1) Flickr server
2) FlickrKit

2 get the hang of swift and JSON
1) swift is the official language by Apple.
2) JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation, used for storing data from Flickr server before them being displayed.
JSON is built on two structures:
(1) A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.
(2) An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.



3 design infinite scolling--roughly four steps
1) show basic content of one page
2) when the user scrolls down to the end of the page , call a function to load more data
from server and append data to the displaying page
3) if there are newer posts, return them 
4) when all the data is shown, stop the process and tell the user all data has been viewed.


4 design user database
