# some techniques in this project
## 1 singleton
A kind of design pattern used for implementing a global accessible instance that saves time(lazy instantiation), buffering or other functions.

## 2 protocol (swift)
like interface in Java

## 3 delegate(swift)
UI technique

## 4 closure(swift)
a function is a special closure.

## 5combining object-C and swift, using third-party lib
both object-C and swift are object-oriented, and therefore they are compatible in the OO layer. Though having different grammar, object-C and swift are able to use the code and object of each other. Consequently, we are able to use third-party lib written in object-C or swift
